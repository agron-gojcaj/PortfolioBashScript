## PortfolioBashScript

Welcome to my Bash Calculator!

This Bash Calculator will allow you to perform **addition, subtraction, multiplication,** and **integer division**
on any 2 numbers of your choosing.

## How to run this script: 

1. First begin by downloading the contents of this repository, particularly portfolio_bash_script.sh in a directory of your choosing.
2. Navigate to that directory in the terminal and run either (bash portfolio_bash_script.sh) or (./portfolio_bash_script.sh)


Note: When doing division, Bash performs integer division, meaning the remainder of the quotient is truncated, or removed.
For example, 7 / 4 = 1.75, but in this calculator, 7 / 4 = 1.
