Welcome to my Bash Calculator!

This Bash Calculator will allow you to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and integer division
on any 2 numbers of your choosing.

Note: When doing division, Bash performs integer division, meaning the remainder of the quotient is truncated, or removed.
For example, 7 / 4 = 1.75, but in this calculator, 7 / 4 = 1.
